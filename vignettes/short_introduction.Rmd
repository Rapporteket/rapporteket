*Rapporteket* is an analysis and reporting service used by Norwegian medical quality registries. The purpose of these registries is to monitor and facilitate quality improvements of public health care in Norway. Based on the underlying data *Rapporteket* provides registries with the ability of data mining, routine reporting and publication. The service is hosted by [Centre for Clinical Documentation and Evaluation](https://helse-nord.no/skde) and funded by [Ministry of Health and Care Services](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/hod/id421/).

Technically, *Rapporteket* is mainly based on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. All code and content (except data) are structured in [R-packages maintained by registry statisticians](https://github.com/Rapporteket).
